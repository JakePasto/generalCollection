Welcome to my Portfolio, here I will give explanations to the creative processes involved in creating the programs in this repository :) 

higherOrLower.py: My first solo made project in python, based around a simple game where you choose a number that the computer attempts to find by prompting randomly selected numbers to the user. The user then responds, telling the computer if the number it guessed was too high, low, or correct, until it eventually finds the correct value. I wanted the game to become automated and additionally have some rooting in statistics, so I created this project, in which you can choose the range of values and total times run, and are given back some stats.
